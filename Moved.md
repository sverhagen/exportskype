# Moved #

Why was this project moved from GitHub, so soon after its inception?

On Dec. 11 GitHub [announced](https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads) that it would remove its "upload files" functionality. It would then no longer be possible to offer the final binaries of this project at the same place as the sources and the docs. Google Code has a full offering: source, wiki, downloads. GitHub is an excellent outlet for the things that they offer, but their offering as a whole is incomplete in terms of being a home for projects such as what is needed here.
