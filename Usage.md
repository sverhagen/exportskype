# Usage #

Make sure you have Java installed. Download an [executable JAR file](http://code.google.com/p/exportskype/downloads/list) and execute it; either:

  * By double-clicking on the executable JAR file
  * In a Command Prompt. This method allows you to see the progress:
> > `java -jar `_<path to executable JAR file>_`/exportskype-`_<version`>`_`.jar`

The output (`./output/SKYPE` folder) can be copied into Trillian logs folder or used in conjunction with [IMmerge](http://zalbee.intricus.net/immerge/).

The above describes how to run the user interface version. For a command-line only version, run as follows:

`java -cp `_<path to executable JAR file>_`/exportskype-`_<version`>`_`.jar com.sander.verhagen.ExportSkypeMain`
